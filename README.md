# Epson ePOS SDK with React JS

Printing from React JS in Epson thermal printer using the Epson ePOS SDK for Javascript.

Printing from a web app looks pretty straightforward, just call the `window.print()` method, and that's it. But that approach has some drawbacks:

- You'll require to create a view of what you want to print (and/or use some printing specific CSS to achieve a proper presentation)
- It will show the user a print dialog, which the user needs to complete in order to begin the printing
- The printing will be a graphical representation of the page
- The client device must have installed the printer drivers

For many scenarios, the above is not so bad. But in a high demand environment (like in a POS application) each one is a drawback that becomes an important impact to performance and productivity:

- Requiring a printer view, could distract the user or lose the current information they're working with.
- Showing the printer dialog demands user extra actions and slows the process of getting the printing.
- Printing graphical demands more network traffic, the printing is slower and doesn't get the maximum printer speed. Raw printing is what POS printers are built for max performance.
- Requiring an installed driver on the client device, is a huge challenge for mobile users and limits application adoption.

So, the **goals** for this project are:

- Printing without changing what the users is looking at. Printing on background, automatically and without showing any dialog.
- Printing raw to reach the maximum printer performance and reduce network traffic.
- Don't need any installed printer driver, and use network connection to the printer, so don't need to physically connect the device to the printer.

## Epson ePOS SDK for JavaScript

This SDK provides a communication solution between JS and the printer, for a wide number of POS printers models. My solution is based on using this SDK.

1. Download the SDK: [https://download.epson-biz.com/modules/pos/index.php?page=single_soft&cid=6679&scat=57&pcat=52](https://download.epson-biz.com/modules/pos/index.php?page=single_soft&cid=6679&scat=57&pcat=52)

2. Unzip the SDK and copy the `epos-2.17.0.js` file to your project under the `public` folder.

3. Reference the script
   As the SDK is not designed to be used on strict mode, to be included in a React app, need to be referenced on `public/index.html` file.

## Printing

Printing to a network printer is like any other communication process, connect to the device and send the requests.

### Connect to the printer

The `connect` function opens the connection with the printer and keeps it open for further printing.

```javascript
let ePosDev = new window.epson.ePOSDevice();
ePosDevice.current = ePosDev;

ePosDev.connect(printerIPAddress, printerPort, (data) => {
  if (data === "OK") {
    ePosDev.createDevice(
      "local_printer",
      ePosDev.DEVICE_TYPE_PRINTER,
      { crypto: true, buffer: false },
      (devobj, retcode) => {
        if (retcode === "OK") {
          printer.current = devobj;
          setConnectionStatus(STATUS_CONNECTED);
        } else {
          throw retcode;
        }
      }
    );
  } else {
    throw data;
  }
});
```

### Send information to the printer

Once the connection to the printer is open, just have to send what you want to print. The `print` function does it:

```javascript
const print = (text) => {
  let prn = printer.current;
  if (!prn) {
    alert("Not connected to printer");
    return;
  }

  prn.addText(text);
  prn.addFeedLine(5);
  prn.addCut(prn.CUT_FEED);

  prn.send();
};
```

### Design your ticket

The SDK provides a lot of methods (`addText`, `addFeedLine`, etc.) to print and use the printer capabilities. [Here you can check the available SDK methods ](https://reference.epson-biz.com/modules/ref_epos_sdk_js_en/index.php?content_id=1#BHIDAHEE)

The easier way to design your ticket is using the SDK included designer. In the SDK folder just navigate to the `/ReceiptDesigner/index.en.html`

On the 'Edit' tab you can add commands to build your format, and on the 'API' tab you'll get the code to print the format:

You can get the code from the `print()` method.
